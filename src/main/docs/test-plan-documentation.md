# Test Plan Documentation
[TOC levels 2-4]

## Introduction
This is a simple document detailing the fundamental tests performed when testing **<insert project here>**. Print this document, provide it to the tester and fill in the test results as necessary.

## Assumptions
Put in any assumptions about the system you're testing.

## Features
The features tested in this test plan are:

* Ability to perform feature xyz

## Resources
* System User
* System Tester
* Developer

## Schedule
Description of how testing will be scheduled.

### Scheduled Dates
| Item             | Date |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Non-prod Testing |      |
| Prod Testing     |      |

## Risks
Any risks associated to performing the tests.

## Testing Methodology
A quantitative approach is used, using several defined test cases. Each test case will clearly define a series of steps to be performed and the desired outcome to quantify pass or failure. Each test is performed sequentially and upon completion of each test the actual outcome is recorded for analysis. A test whose actual outcome is the same as its expected outcome is considered a successful test and vice versa.

## Test Suite
The following diagrams detail the user test cases and their expectations within the application.

| ID              | Details |
|:--------------- |:------- |
| Product Version |         |
| Conducted by    |         |
| Date Conducted  |         |

### Pre-conditions   
Note any pre-conditions here prior to testing.

### Test Case 1
| Detail      | Value                                                                     |
|:----------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ID          | `<application_name>-tc-01`           |
| Description | Test that a user can do xyz using the application |

#### Execution Steps                                                                                                                          

1. First do this...
2. Then do that...
3. etc...


| Detail           | Value                                 |
|:---------------- |:--------------------------------------|
| Expected outcome | The application should have done xyz  |
| Actual outcome   | <br><br><br>                          |
| PASS / FAIL      |                                       |

### Post-conditions
Put any post-conditions related to completing the testing here.

## Deliverables
The resultant deliverable from having conducted these tests is a system that's capable of performing xyz. The system will also have the correct expected behaviour as confirmed by the user.
